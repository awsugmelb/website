### Notes

- Venues: 80-120 capacity, AV requirements, catering?, wifi. Possible options: A Cloud Guru, Digio, Contino, etc
- Diversity target of 50% of speakers
- Better time keeping on the night. Publish agenda with times
- Sponsoring smaller AWS-related groups either as a child group (via Meetup Pro) or assisting with sponsorship/venue connections
- Keep the same format, start at 6pm instead of 6:10pm, add in a 10 minute lightning talk reserved for first time speakers or Level 100 talks. Provide speaking mentorship.
- Check-in app + label printer, or pre-print the [meetup.com](http://meetup.com) labels. Require first name for RSVP.
- Look at the Lanyard app that the AWS UG India guys built. Features for our app should include: Meetup list, agenda for each, RSVP, integration with Meetup.com, Check-in at the venue, venue details/map and most importantly: avenue for feedback (anonymous or otherwise), CoC reporting, etc.
