Hi everyone.

We, that is the current organisers committee, have been talking for a while now about registering as an [Incorporated Association](https://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/clubs-and-fundraising/incorporated-associations) with [Consumer Affairs Victoria](https://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/). This puts some additional overhead on us around record keeping and meeting minutes, but it also gives us a lot of advantages around legal liability and financial control (we'd be a registered not-for-profit organisation). You can read more on the advantages [here](https://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/clubs-and-fundraising/incorporated-associations/become-an-incorporated-association/should-your-club-incorporate).

It also allows us to open up the structure of the user group to be more transparent in our decision making and directions; and means we can inject a bit more democracy into things.

We will therefore be holding a Special General Meeting on April 28th, the business of which will be to propose the incorporation of Melbourne AWS User Group Inc. We propose as well to adopt the [Model Rules](https://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/clubs-and-fundraising/incorporated-associations/running-an-incorporated-association/rules#model-rules) provided by the [Associations Incorporation Reform Act 2012](https://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/in-force/acts/associations-incorporation-reform-act-2012).

You can find out more at [Meeting Notices](/association/notices), you can also check out the [proposed rules](/association/rules).
