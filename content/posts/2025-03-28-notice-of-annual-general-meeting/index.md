Hello everyone,

In line with the [rules](/association/rules/) of the [Melbourne AWS User Group Inc](/association/) (the [incorporated association](https://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/clubs-and-fundraising/incorporated-associations) that manages the day to day operations of the user group), we'd like to give notice of our intention to hold our Annual General Meeting on Wednesday the 23rd of April 2025 at 12:30am over Zoom.

Invitation is open to all members of the association but not to the general community. If youâ€™re interested in becoming a member of the assocation you can learn more [here](/association/members#becoming-a-member).
