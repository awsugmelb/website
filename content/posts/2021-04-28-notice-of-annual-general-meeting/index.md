Hi everyone.

In line with the [rules](/association/rules/) of the [Melbourne AWS User Group Inc](/association/) (the [incorporated association](https://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/clubs-and-fundraising/incorporated-associations) that manages the day to day operations of the user group), we'd like to give notice of our intention to hold our Annual General Meeting on Tuesday the 11th of May 2021 via Zoom.

Invitation is open to all members of the association but not to the general community. If youâ€™re interested in becoming a member of the assocation you can learn more [here](/association/members#becoming-a-member).

For event details please ask in the #volunteers channel on Slack.
