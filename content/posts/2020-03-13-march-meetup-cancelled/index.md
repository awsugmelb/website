The Melbourne AWS User Group has decided to cancel March's event.

Like everyone, we have watched the situation rapidly worsen in Victoria in the past 3 days and in conjunction with our venue, sponsors and speakers we've come to the decision that it would be irresponsible to proceed with March's planned meetup. Even though there has been no official directive from Victoria's Chief Medical Officer there has been no indication that the worst is behind us and we feel it is in the best interest of the community to place the health and safety of everyone involved first and be as cautious as possible.

Our next event then will be April 29. At this time we're dedicated to ensuring that this and future events go ahead. Hopefully the situation improves and it will be back at NAB House as normal, but if not we will look at doing something online only.

Don't forget that our in-person events are not the only way to connect and network with other members of the community. There are more than 600 people on our Slack team, which has a number of great channels where you can ask AWS questions, or discuss news, outages or available jobs. You can [find out more and join the team from our website](https://melb.awsug.org.au/slack).

If you have any ideas or suggestions on what would make a good online only event please join us in #volunteers on Slack.

You can also follow us on Twitter ([@awsmelb](https://twitter.com/awsmelb)) to keep up with the latest in the community.

We hope everyone takes all necessary precautions during this time and stays healthy.

Cheers,<br />
Rob and Arjen<br />
