Hello everyone,

In line with the [rules](/association/rules/) of the [Melbourne AWS User Group Inc](/association/) (the [incorporated association](https://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/clubs-and-fundraising/incorporated-associations) that manages the day to day operations of the user group), we'd like to give notice of our intention to hold our Annual General Meeting on Thursday the 4th of April 2024 at 10:30am over Zoom.

Invitation is open to all members of the association but not to the general community. If youâ€™re interested in becoming a member of the assocation you can learn more [here](/association/members#becoming-a-member).

For event details please ask in the #volunteers channel on Slack.
