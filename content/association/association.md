## Why an Association?

There are a number of benefits to registering as an incorporated association. The Consumer Affairs Victoria website has a great breakdown on the [advantages and disadvantages](https://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/clubs-and-fundraising/incorporated-associations/become-an-incorporated-association/should-your-club-incorporate).

In general, being a registered association gives us a lot of advantages that were attractive, such as a more secure financial foundation (we're a registered not-for-profit organisation), the ability to open our own bank account instead of relying on the organisers' business accounts, some level of protection against liability and the ability to take things to the next level.

As well, we see the small increased burden in formalising the user group as an advantage as well. The requirements for better record keeping and publishing minutes of all meetings benefits the community as well. It helps us be more open and transparent, and the structure we've chosen can help democratise the user group and give the community a larger voice.
