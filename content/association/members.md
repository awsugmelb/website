Members of the **Melbourne AWS User Group Inc.** have an important role to play in the running of the Melborne AWS User Group.

You do not need to be a member of the association to attend our events or join any of our digital channels. They are open to the public and are free of charge.

## Eligiblity

Anyone over the age of 15 can be a member of the association. However, as our events and digital channels exist for the benefit of the community as a whole, not just members, we generally restrict membership of the association to regular attendees and active volunteers. This is to keep the adminstrative overhead of managing an association down.

## General rights and duties

The rights and duties of a member of the Melbourne AWS User Group Inc. are:

- vote in general and special meetings,
- submit items of business for consideration at meetings,
- participate in the committee or sub-committees as appropriate.

More information about membership can be found in the [association rules](/association/rules#division-1--membership).

## Becoming a member

Most likely you will be invited to become a member of the association when you are an active volunteer or contributer.

Applications to become a member must be submitted in writing to the committee at <a href="mailto:committee@awsug.org.au">committee@awsug.org.au</a>. The committee will need to consider your application as soon as practical and approve or reject it by a formal resolution at the next committee meeting.

There is no annual fee for becoming a member; the Melbourne AWS User Group's income is solely from sponsorship.
