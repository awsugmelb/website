Meetups cost money to run, sponsorship is a great way to promote your product or company within the community.

## Support the AWS Community
Sponsorship enables us to put on the events – venues and catering are not cheap! Your support means the community has a place where we can meet regularly to learn and play.

## Promote your brand
Get those warm and fuzzies going with your community sponsorship! Not only is it a good look, we also make sure to thank our sponsors whenever and where-ever we can.

## Build your team
AWS User Group members are engaged and enthusiastic about the industry, and often they are looking for work within it. The community is a great place to make contacts and build relationships.
