The Melbourne AWS User Group has one of the most active AWS-related Slack teams in the world, with over 600 members and 20% active on any given weekday.


It is a great place to ask questions, talk shop and make connections.

## Channels

As with any Slack team, discussion happens across a number of channels based around loose purposes, a few of those are listed below.

### #general {class="display-6 text-secondary"}

The place for general conversation, AWS questions, comments, frustrations, etc. Anything goes! (But don't forget the [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct/)).

### #announcements {class="display-6 text-secondary"}

The place where news comes in (via the AWS news bot) and new features are discussed.

### #awsoutages {class="display-6 text-secondary"}

### #jobs {class="display-6 text-secondary"}

Looking for skilled AWS employees? Or AWS-related work? The place where jobs are posted.

### #melbourne {class="display-6 text-secondary"}
