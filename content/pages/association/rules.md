All Incorporated Associations must have rules, sometimes referred to as their constitution. The rules guide the running of the association, but do not affect the day to day running of events and general business.

{{< modal callout-secondary "Model Rules" >}}
The Melbourne AWS User Group Inc. has adopted _Model Rules_. This means we have agreed to abide by the [rules created by Consumer Affairs Victoria](https://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/clubs-and-fundraising/incorporated-associations/running-an-incorporated-association/rules#model-rules) in running the assoication. This has numerous benefits including reduced operating costs (and less lawyers!), but it also means that CAV can and does make changes to those rules on our behalf. As such, please refer to the [Model Rules](https://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/clubs-and-fundraising/incorporated-associations/running-an-incorporated-association/rules#model-rules) for the authoratative copy of the rules.
